## Portable Skyrim

This website is about creating a Skyrim setup with the following attributes

- heavily modded using "ModOrganizer 2"
- modding setup and game saves seamlessly synced between a stationary gaming PC and a mobile gaming device. Start your adventure on the PC, begin a new quest, then quit the game when you go to bed - and sync the saves to the portable. Next morning, when you leave the house to commute to the office, continue your quest while sitting in the bus.
- settings ("ultra", "high", "low" etc.) being adjusted accordingly for each system, so you can play in glorious 4k on the big PC, and in an adjusted configuration on the portable, but with the same shared mods, extensions etc.
