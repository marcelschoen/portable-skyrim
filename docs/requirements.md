### Required tools and software

- Windows PC and Windows gaming portable (e.g. AyaNeo). 
- "Skyrim: Special Edition" - to be precise, version 1.640 !!! This is technically really the so-called "Anniversary Edition", which may be relevant sometimes which chosing the right version of a given mod to download and install.
- "ModOrganizer 2" - one of the best and most versatile modding tools for Skyrim (and other games). One huge advantage is that it uses a virtual file system for overlaying the mods over the game's pre-installed files; because of that, the actual Skyrim installation is never touched by MO2, and changing / enabling / disabling mods is also a very fast and quick thing to do. With "MO2", a few associated tools will be installed too:

    * SKSE (Skyrim script extender, a basic requirement for many mods)
    * BethINI, a powerful configuration tool that allows to adjust and fine-tune your settings far better than the simplistic default launcher settings dialog
    * Possibly more MO2 related tools, but that depends also on what mods you want to use.

- "FreeFileSync" - A great, free GUI tool for syncing data between drives, much like rsync, but with a simple UI. This can be used later to not only save game saves between the two systems, but also the entire modding setup.
