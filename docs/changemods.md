### Maintaining mod changes

Whenever you want to install or remove mods, the workflow will basically be this:

* Change modding setup on gaming PC, in MO2
* Test out the setup on the PC
* When it's OK, run the sync profile "SkyrimModsSync_PC2portable" to sync all the mod changes down to the portable.

That's it. Now you can launch the game with the same mods on the portable (with MO2).
