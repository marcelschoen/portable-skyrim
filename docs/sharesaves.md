### Start sharing a game save

* Start an actual game on your PC. Save whenever you want.
* Exit to the desktop
* Make sure your portable is on, and its D: drive is mounted as X: and accessible (device not sleeping etc.)
* Run the sync profile "SkyrimSyncSaves" and watch your game saves getting synced from the PC to the portable

Take the portable out of the dock, launch Steam, launch MO2, and then Skyrim - and continue right where you left off on the PC. Since the sync goes both ways, you can then just put the portable back in the dock later, exit skyrim there of course, and then run the same sync profile again to sync the never game saves from the portable back to the PC.
