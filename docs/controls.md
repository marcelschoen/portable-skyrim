### Control issues

Naturally, on a portable device you will have to play Skyrim using the gamepad control settings. On the PC, you will probably prefer mouse and keyboard. You will have to change the settings accordingly once. The nice thing is that Skyrim stores these settings in your profile data, so syncing the saves will not sync these settings. So, once you have configured this correctly on both systems, you can play with mouse/keyboard on PC, sync the saves, continue with joypad on the portable etc.

This is the recommended procedure to get there:

* Begin your game on the PC, and the settings will be set to mouse/keyboard.
* Exit and sync the saves to the portable.
* Leave your portable in the dock (if it has one) and make sure you connect mouse and keyboard to it.
* Launch Skyrim with MO2 on the portable, and then in the game, go into the settings and switch to the "gamepad" control scheme.
* When you exit the settings menu, Skyrim will save it and immediately disable mouse/keyboard control.
* Now you can play with the gamepad on the portable.
