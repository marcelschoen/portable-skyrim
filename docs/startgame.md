### Start A Modded Game

* Download mods you want to use from Nexus, using MO2, on the PC
* Launch the modded game on the PC, test the mods, adjust etc.
* Exit the game and start the "FreeFileSync" tool
* Make sure the portable is on and its shared directory mounted on the PC
* Run the profile "FullSkyrimSync_PC2portable" once. This may take a while. As a result, you will have basically the identical setup on your portable - including the settings, which you'll need to fix once before launching on the portable.
* On the portable device, start MO2 and launch "BethINI", and adjust the settings (again). Hint: Save them as a profile somewhere so you can easily restore them in case you accidentally overwrite them again later with a full sync.
* Now launch Skyrim on the portable with MO2 - you should now be running the game with the same mods that you installed on the PC.

IMPORTANT: You MUST launch the modded game with MO2, not through Steam... otherwise you won't get a modded game at all.
