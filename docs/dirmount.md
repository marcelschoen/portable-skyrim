### Prepare directory mount

In order to be able to sync files between the two systems, you may use simple shared directories. You will most likely have to share the D: drive on the portable device, since you will probably be running the sync software from the gaming PC, so the gaming PC needs to mount the drive D: of the portable device into a local device like "X:".

* Share drive "D:" on your portable device (full access)
* Mount it on your gaming PC as drive X:

You should now be able to access the D: drive of your portable on your gaming PC in the Windows explorer.
